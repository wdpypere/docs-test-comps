### NAME

EDG::WP4::CCM::Fetch::Download

### DESCRIPTION

Module provides methods to handle the retrieval of the profiles.

### Functions

- retrieve

    Stores $url into $cache if it's newer than $time, or if $self->{FORCE}
    is set.

    It returns undef in case of error, 0 if it there were no changes on the
    remote server since `$time` (the server returned a 304 code)
    and a `CAF::FileWriter` object with the
    downloaded contents if they had to be downloaded.

    Should be called ony by `download`.

- download

    Downloads the files associated with $type (profile or context). In
    case of error it retries $self->{RETRIEVE\_RETRIES} times, falling back
    to a failover URL if necessary (thus up to 2\*$self->{RETRIEVE\_RETRIES}
    may happen.

    Returns undef (or dies) in case of error, or the result from `retrieve` method otherwise:

    - 0 if nothing had to be retrieved (files in the server were older than our local cache)
    - a `CAF::FileWriter` object with the downloaded contents, if something was actually
    downloaded
