### NAME

EDG::WP4::CCM::Fetch

### SYNOPSIS

    $fetch = EDG::WP4::CCM::Fetch->new({PROFILE_URL => "profile_url or hostname",
                        CONFIG  => "path of config file",
                        FOREIGN => "1/0"});
    $fetch->fetchProfile();

### DESCRIPTION

Module provides Fetch class. This helps in retrieving XML profiles and
from specified URLs. It allows users to retrieve local, as
well as foreign node profiles.

### Functions

- new()

        new({PROFILE_URL => "profile_url or hostname",
             CONFIG  => "path of config file",
             FOREIGN => "1/0"});

    Creates new Fetch object. Full url of the profile can be provided as
    parameter PROFILE\_URL, if it is not a url a profile url will be
    calculated using 'base\_url' config option in `/etc/ccm.conf`.  Path of
    alternative configuration file can be given as CONFIG.

    Returns undef in case of error.

- fetchProfile()

    fetchProfile  fetches the  profile  from  profile url and keeps it at
    configured area.  The  cache  root variable is set as
    $fetch\_handle{'CACHE\_ROOT'} which can further be passed to CacheManager
    object and use NVA-API to access Resources and Properties.

    If the profile is foreign, then the cache\_root configuration is expected
    to be just for this foreign host and unexpected behaviour will result
    if the cache\_root is shared. Only a single (most recent) copy of the
    foreign copy will be stored: previous versions will be removed. Foreign
    profiles do not use failover URLs: if the primary URL is unavailable,
    then the fetch will fail.

    Returns undef if it cannot fetch the profile due to a network error,
    `<$EDG::WP4::CCM::Fetch::ProfileCache::ERROR`> in case of other failure,
    `SUCCESS` in case of successful fetch, but no updated profile
    and `CHANGED` in case of successful fetch and
    updated profile.
