### NAME

EDG::WP4::CCM::Path - Path class

### SYNOPSIS

    $path = EDG::WP4::CCM::Path->new("/hardware/memory/size");
    print "$path"; # stringification

    $path = $path->down($level);

    $path = $path->up();

### DESCRIPTION

Module provides implementation of the Path class. Class is used
to manipulate absolute paths

#### Public methods

- new ($path)

    Create new `EDG::WP4::CCM::Path` instance.

    If [path](../components/path.md) argument is not specified, root path (`/`) is used.
    Empty string is not allowed as an argument.

    [path](../components/path.md) is a string representation of the path as defined in the NVA-API
    Specification document.

- depth

    Return the number of subpaths, starting from `/`.

- get\_last

    Return last (safe unescaped) subpath or undef in case of `/`.
    The `strip_unescape` boolean is passed to `_safe_unescape`.

- toString

    Get the (raw) string representation of path.

    The `EDG::WP4::CCM::Path` instances also support stringification
    (the `_stringify` method is used for that) and might create different result
    due to `safe_unescape`.

- \_boolean

    bool overload: `Path` instance is always true (avoids stringification on logic test)

- \_stringify

    Method for overloaded stringification.

    This includes support for `safe_unescape` to wrap
    unescaped subpaths in `{}`.

- up

    Removes last chunk of the path and returns it.
    If the path is already `/` then the method
    raises an exception.

- down

    Add `chunk` to the path. The chunk can be compound path.
    (A leading `/` will be ignored).

- merge

    Return a new instance with optional (list of) subpaths added.

- parent

    Return a new instance with parent path.
    Returns undef if current element is `/`.

#### Public functions

- unescape

    Returns an unescaped version of the argument. This method is exported
    for use with all the components that deal with escaped keys.

- escape

    Returns an escaped version of the argument.  This method is exported on
    demand for use with all tools that have to escape and unescape values.

- path\_split

    Function to split a string in list of subpaths.
    Supports escaping of subpaths wrapped in `{...}`.

- set\_safe\_unescape

    Set the list of (parent) paths whose children are known to be escaped paths.
    (The list is set to all arguments passed, not appended to current safe\_unescape list).

    Paths can either be strings (an exact match will be used)
    or compiled regular expressions.

    These child subpaths are safe to represent as their unescaped value
    wrapped in `{}` when &lt;toString> method is called (e.g. during stringification).

    Parent paths who have a safe-to escape parent path of their own should be added
    already escaped.

    The list is stored in the `safe_unescape` module variable and
    can emptied with `reset_safe_unescape` exported functions.

    If no argument is passed, a predefined list of paths is used. The paths are known
    to be escaped in quattor profiles, e.g. `/software/components/metaconfig/services`.
    (To reset the active `safe_unescape` list, use `reset_safe_unescape` function.

- reset\_safe\_unescape

    Reset the `safe_unescape` list.

- \_safe\_unescape

    Given [path](../components/path.md) and `subpath`, test is [path](../components/path.md) is in `@safe_unescape`
    and if it is, return unescaped subpath enclosed in `{}` (or not enclosed if
    `strip_unescape` is true).

    If not, return unmodified subpath.
