### NAME

EDG::WP4::CCM::CacheManager::Encode - Module with DB encoding functions and constants

### DESCRIPTION

`EDG::WP4::CCM::CacheManager::Encode` implements the functions
that provide the encoding of metadata in the DB instance used.

The DB is build as follows:

- In `EDG::WP4::CCM::Fetch::ProfileCache` the profile is converted to a hashref
with subpath as key and hashref with data and metadata as value.
- The hashref is walked building up the path and a counter (the `eid`) is increased for each path
- The relation between the path and the counter is stored in the `path2eid` DB with
path as key and encoded eid (using `db_keys($eid)-`{VALUE}>) as value.
- The data and metadata are stored in `eid2data` DB using the encoded eid (which has offset
for each type of data and metadata) as key and the data as value.

Access to data based on path is possible without en/decoding (`eid2data->{path2eid->{$path}}`).

Access to the metadata however requires decoding of the encoded eid from path2eid; to recompute
the encoded keys for the metadata.

#### Type constants:

    ELEMENT
      PROPERTY
        STRING
        LONG
        DOUBLE
        BOOLEAN
        LINK
      RESOURCE
        NLIST
          TABLE
          RECORD
        LIST

#### Functions

- type\_from\_name

    Convert a type in string format into a type constant.

    Returns `UNDEFINED` constant and warns when name is not supported.

- decode\_eid

    Return decoded eid.

- encode\_eids

    Given `eid`, return the keys of the tie'ed DB hashref
    for `VALUE`, `TYPE`, `DERIVATION`, `CHECKSUM` and `DESCRIPTION`
    as used in the `eid2data` DB.
