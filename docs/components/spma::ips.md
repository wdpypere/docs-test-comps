### NAME

NCM::Component::spma::ips - NCM SPMA configuration component for IPS

### SYNOPSIS

**Configure ()**

### DESCRIPTION

Invoked by **NCM::Component::spma** via `ncm-ncd --configure ncm-spma` when
`/software/components/spma/packager` is **ips**. Processes requests for
IPS packages to be added to a new Solaris boot environment and generates a
command file that may be executed by `spma-run`.

This module is intended for package management with Quattor on Solaris 11
or later.

### RESOURCES

- `/software/catalogues` ? nlist {}

    A list of catalogues (package groups) to install. The format is:

    `{_package_name_}/{_version_}`

    For example:

        prefix '/software/catalogues';
        '{pkg://solaris/entire}/{0.5.11,5.11-0.175.1.10.0.5.0}' = '';

    The intention is that a host's software inventory is predominantly defined
    by a small number of software catalogues that pull in almost all of the
    packages required for the build.

    Catalogues must be versioned and a host is progressed from one version
    of a build to another by shifting the catalogue version numbers.

- `/software/requests` ? nlist ()

    A list of additional packages to install. The format is:

    `{_package_name_}[/{_version_}]`

    For example:

        '/software/requests/{ms/afs/client}' = nlist();
        '/software/requests/{idr537}/{2}' = '';

    The version number is optional and should generally be omitted. It is
    intended that the version number of packages that can be requested individually
    are defined by a catalogue (e.g. constrained by an incorporate dependency).

- `/software/uninstall` ? nlist ()

    A list of packages to uninstall. Packages in this list will not be installed,
    and will be passed to the `pkg install` command via the `--reject` option.
    The format is the same as with `/software/requests`.

- `/software/components/spma/packager` ? string

    Must contain '**ips**' to use this module.

- `/software/components/spma/run` ? string

    Set to **yes** to allow this module to launch `spma-run --execute` to make
    immediate changes to the new boot environment. If set to **no** or omitted,
    this module prepares and validates the changes only, but does not perform
    any updates, it will be the responsibility of an external process to launch
    `spma-run --execute` in this case.

- `/software/components/spma/userpkgs` ? string

    Set to **yes** to allow user-installed packages. If set to **no** or omitted,
    then SPMA will find all leaf packages that have not been requested and
    uninstall them via `--reject` arguments to `pkg install`.

- `/software/components/spma/pkgpaths` : string \[\]

    Contains a list of resource paths where catalogues and individual package
    requests are located. Should be set to:

        list("/software/catalogues", "/software/requests");

- `/software/components/spma/uninstpaths` : string \[\]

    Contains a list of resource paths where packages to uninstall are located.
    Should be set to:

        list("/software/uninstall");

- `/software/components/spma/cmdfile` : string

    Where to save commands for the `spma-run` script. Default location
    is `/var/tmp/spma-commands`.

- `/software/components/spma/flagfile` ? string

    File to touch if `/software/components/spma/run` is set to **no** and this
    module has determined that there is work to do, i.e. packages to install or
    to uninstall. If the file exists after this module has completed, then
    `spma-run --execute` can be run to create a new BE and make package changes
    in that BE.

- `/software/components/spma/ips/bename` ? string

    Name of boot environment that `spma-run` will use when making any
    changes to packages. If a BE by that name already exists, then a
    unique number will be appended to the name. Package changes will
    be effected via `pkg install --be-name <bename>`.

    If this resource is missing then `pkg install --require-new-be` will be used
    instead, leaving Solaris to decide on the name of the new BE.

- `/software/components/spma/ips/rejectidr` : boolean

    Add a `--reject` option to the `pkg install` command for every Solaris IDR
    installed that has not been explicitly requested.

    Default is **true**.

- `/software/components/spma/ips/freeze` : boolean

    Ignore frozen packages. This will prevent SPMA from updating or uninstalling
    frozen packages.

    Default is **true**.

### NOTES

This module does not support making changes in the currently active boot
environment. The intention is that it is executed when a host is rebooted
via a call to `ncm-ncd -configure spma` and then `spma-run --execute`
called immediately afterwards. The system will then reboot into the
newly created boot environment if any changes were made.

IPS publisher configuration is currently not supported by this module.

### EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

The following PAN code snippet demonstrates how to prepare SPMA for
Solaris:

    #
    ### Configure SPMA appropriately for Solaris
    #
    prefix "/software/components/spma";
    "packager" = "ips";
    "pkgpaths" = list("/software/catalogues", "/software/requests");
    "uninstpaths" = list("/software/uninstall");
    "register_change" = list("/software/catalogues",
                             "/software/requests",
                             "/software/uninstall");
    "flagfile" = "/var/tmp/spma-run-flag"
