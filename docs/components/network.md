### NAME

network: Configure Network Settings

### DESCRIPTION

The _network_ component sets the network settings through `/etc/sysconfig/network`
and the various files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`.

New/changed settings are first tested by retrieving the latest profile from the
CDB server (using ccm-fetch).
If this fails, the component reverts all settings to the previous values.

During this test, a sleep value of 15 seconds is used to make sure the restarted network
is fully restarted (routing may need some time to come up completely).

Because of this, configuration changes may cause the ncm-ncd run to take longer than usual.

Be aware that configuration changes can also lead to a brief network interruption.

### EXAMPLES

#### CHANNEL BONDING

To enable channel bonding with quattor using devices eth0 and eth1 to form bond0, proceed as follows:

    include 'components/network/config';
    prefix "/system/network/interfaces";
    "eth0/bootproto" = "none";
    "eth0/master" = "bond0";

    "eth1/bootproto" = "none";
    "eth1/master" = "bond0";

    "bond0" = NETWORK_PARAMS;
    "bond0/driver" = "bonding";
    "bond0/bonding_opts/mode" = 6;
    "bond0/bonding_opts/miimon" = 100;

    include 'components/modprobe/config';
    "/software/components/modprobe/modules" = append(dict("name", "bonding", "alias", "bond0"));

    "/software/components/network/dependencies/pre" = append("modprobe");

(see `<kernel>/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt` for more info on the driver options)

#### VLAN support

Use the `vlan[0-9]{0-4}` interface devices and set the explicit device name and physdev.
The VLAN ID is the number of the '.' in the device name.
` physdev ` is mandatory for `vlan[0-9]{0-4}` device.

An example:

    prefix "/system/network/interfaces";
    "vlan0" = VLAN_NETWORK_PARAMS;
    "vlan0/device" = "eth0.3";
    "vlan0/physdev" = "eth0";

#### IPv6 support

An example:

    prefix "/system/network";
    "ipv6/enabled" = true;
    "ipv6/default_gateway" = "2001:678:123:e030::1";
    "interfaces/eth0/ipv6_autoconf" = false;
    "interfaces/eth0/ipv6addr" = "2001:610:120:e030::49/64";
    "interfaces/eth0/ipv6addr_secondaries" = list(
        "2001:678:123:e030::20:30/64",
        "2001:678:123:e030:172:10:20:30/64",
        );
