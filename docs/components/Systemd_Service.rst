NCM::Component::Systemd::Service handles the \ ``ncm-systemd``\  units.

Public methods
==============



new
 
 Returns a new object with argument \ ``base``\  (the configuration path)
 and accepts the following options
 
 
 log
  
  A logger instance (compatible with \ ``CAF::Object``\ ).
  
 
 


configure
 
 \ ``configure``\  gathered the to-be-configured units from the \ ``config``\  using the
 \ ``gather_units``\  method and then takes appropriate actions.
 



Private methods
===============



set_unconfigured_default
 
 Return the default behaviour for unconfigured units from \ ``ncn-systemd``\ 
 and legacy \ ``ncm-chkconfig``\ .
 


gather_configured_units
 
 Gather the list of all configured units from both \ ``ncm-systemd``\ 
 and legacy \ ``ncm-chkconfig``\  location, and take appropriate actions.
 
 For any unit defined in both \ ``ncm-systemd``\  and \ ``ncm-chkconfig``\  location,
 the \ ``ncm-systemd``\  settings will be used.
 
 Returns a hash reference with key the unit name and value the unit detail.
 


gather_current_units
 
 Gather list of current units from both \ ``systemctl``\  and legacy \ ``chkconfig``\ 
 using resp. \ ``unit``\  and \ ``chkconfig``\  \ ``current_units``\  methods.
 
 The hashref \ ``relevant_units``\  is used to run minimal set
 of system commands where possible: e.g. if the hashref represents the
 configured units and if \ ``unconfigured``\  is \ ``ignore``\ , only gathered
 details for these units.
 


process
 
 \ ``process``\  the \ ``configured``\  and \ ``current``\  units and
 return hash references with state and activation changes.
 
 It uses the \ ``current``\  units to make the required decisions.
 Unconfigured current units are also processed according the
 \ ``unconfigured``\  value.
 


change
 
 Actually make the changes as specified in
 the hashrefs \ ``states``\  and \ ``acts``\  (which hold the
 changes to be made to resp. the state and the activity
 of the units).
