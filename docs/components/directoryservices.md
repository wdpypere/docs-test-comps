### NAME

directoryservices : Directory Services NCM component.

### DESCRIPTION

Component to manage directory services on OS X. This can both setup local directory (e.g. for MCX purposes) and provide linkage to external open directory services. When defining a network open directory server, the configuration is at the moment pretty "raw" - interpreted and passed "as-is" to OS X.
