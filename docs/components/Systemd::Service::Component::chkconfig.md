####  Methods

- \_set\_name

    Set and return name to use for prefix to get the the standard configuration path
    for the systemd component `</software/components/systemd`>
    (not the `chkconfig` one through inheritance).

    This allows for easier subclassing, but is not safe for component aliasing.

- \_initialize

    Modify the inheritance to set the `NAME` attribute via `_set_name` method.

- skip

    Skip all but service configuration.
