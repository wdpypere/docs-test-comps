### NAME

`NCM::Component::spma::apt` - NCM SPMA backend for apt

### SYNOPSIS

This document describes how to control the behaviour of the package manager itself.
For information on how to manage packages with Quattor, please check

### DESCRIPTION

This plugin implements an apt backend for `ncm-spma`, the approach taken is to defer as much work as possible to apt.

A single SPMA run consists of the following steps:

- Setup source directory if required
- Remove sources that are not found in the profile
- Update source cache from upstream sources
- Upgrade already installed packages
- Install packages specified in the profile that are not installed
- Mark any packages installed but not in the profile as automatically installed
- Ask apt to remove all automatically installed packages that are not satisfying dependencies of other packages

### RESOURCES

Only a very minimal schema is implemented.

Sources listed under `/software/repositories` will be configured,
URLs should be followed by the suite and sections required e.g. `http://example.org/debian unstable main`

Packages listed under `/software/packages` will be installed, version and architecture locking (including multiarch) is fully implemented.
