NAME

NCM::Component::Systemd::Service::Chkconfig is a class handling services
that can be controlled via (older) \ ``ncm-chkconfig``\ .

Public methods
==============



new
 
 Returns a new object, accepts the following options
 
 
 log
  
  A logger instance (compatible with \ ``CAF::Object``\ ).
  
 
 


current_units
 
 Return hash reference with current configured units
 determined via \ ``chkconfig --list``\ .
 
 (No type to specify, \ ``sysv``\  type is forced).
 


current_target
 
 Return the current target based on legacy \ ``current_runlevel``\ .
 


default_target
 
 Return the default target based on legacy \ ``default_runlevel``\ .
 


configured_units
 
 \ ``configured_units``\  parses the \ ``tree``\  hash reference and builds up the
 units to be configured. It returns a hash reference with key the unit name and
 values the details of the unit.
 
 (\ ``tree``\  is typically \ ``$config-``\ getElement('/software/components/chkconfig/service')->getTree>.)
 
 This method converts the legacy states as following
 
 
 del : masked
 
 
 
 add: disabled
 
 
 
 off : disabled
 
 
 
 on : enabled
 
 
 
 reset: this state is ignored / not supported.
 
 
 



Private methods
===============



is_possible_missing
 
 Determine if \ ``unit``\  is \ ``possible_missing``\ 
 (see \ ``make_cache_alias``\ ). (Returns 0 or 1).
 
 A unit is possible_missing if
 
 
 the unit is in state masked or disabled (i.e. unit that is not expected to be running anyway).
  
  Other then pure systemd, chkconfig state off always implies
  that a disabled service unit is not running.
  
 
 


generate_runlevel2target
 
 Create, set and return the \ ``runlevel2target``\  map
 (will reset existing one, return is merely for testing).
 


convert_runlevels
 
 Convert the \ ``ncm-chkconfig``\  levels to new systemsctl targets
 
 \ ``legacylevel``\  is a string with integers e.g. "234".
 Retrun a array reference with the targets.
 


default_runlevel
 
 \ ``default_runlevel``\  returns the default runlevel
 via the INITTAB file. If that fails, the default
 DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL is returned.
 


current_runlevel
 
 Return the current legacy runlevel.
 
 The rulevel is determined by trying (in order)
 \ ``/sbin/runlevel``\  or \ ``who -r``\ . If both fail, the
 \ ``default_runlevel``\  method is called and its value
 is returned.
