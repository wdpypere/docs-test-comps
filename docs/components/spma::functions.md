### Types
### Functions

- repository_exists
    - description: Utility function to determine if at least one particular child element exists.  (Used in the checking of the repositories.) 
    - arg: name
    - arg: path to list of dicts with at least one key 'name'
- resolve_pkg_rep
    - description: Automatically fill "repository" field for package list 
    - arg: repository list
    - arg: (optional) package list.  When specified, only the package(s) specified are resolved, if they exist in the configuration.
- purge_rep_list
    - description: Remove unneeded repository information 
    - arg: repository list
- pkg_del
    - description: Remove package from list. If the package is not part of the configuration, silently exit: this is not considered as an error. 
    - arg: name
    - arg: (optional) version. If version is not specified (no argument provided) or is the empty string then ALL existing versions are removed from the profile.
    - arg: (optional) arch. If arch is not specified (no argument provided), then ALL existing archs for the specified version are removed from the profile.
- pkg_repl
    - arg: name
    - arg: (optional) new version
    - arg: (optional) arch
    - arg: (optional) options. pkg_repl() is the real workhorse of pkg_add/pkg_del/pkg_repl/pkg_ronly. Other functions are just wrappers of pkg_repl(). 'options' argument is used to tailor this function behaviour for a particular purpose and is normally used only by other pkg_xxx functions.
- pkg_add
    - arg: name
    - arg: (optional) version
    - arg: (optional) arch
- pkg_ronly
    - description: Replace package in the list ONLY if present. Same as pkg_repl() except that if no version existed in the profile, NO new version is added. See pkg_repl() for argument documentation. 
    - arg: name
    - arg: (optional) version
    - arg: (optional) arch
