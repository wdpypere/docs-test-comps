### NAME

sysconfig: management of sysconfig files

### DESCRIPTION

The _sysconfig_ component manages system configuration files in
`/etc/sysconfig` . These are files which contain key-value pairs.
However there is the possibility to add verbatim text either
before or after the key-value pair definitions.

### FILE DEFINITIONS

- `/software/components/sysconfig/files`

    This is an nlist which has the file name (unescaped) as the key, and
    the content information as the value. The value is an nlist.

- `/software/components/sysconfig/files/<fname>/`

    This is a nlist containing key-value pairs. Both are strings.
    There are two special keys `prologue` and `epilogue` which contain
    text which will be copied verbatim into the file before or after
    the pair definitions, respectively.

### EXAMPLE

    "/software/components/sysconfig/files/scfg" =
      nlist("epilogue", "export LANG=C",
          "KEY", "VALUE");

This will create the file `/etc/sysconfig/scfg` which contains:

    KEY=VALUE
    export LANG=C
