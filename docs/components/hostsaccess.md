### NAME

hostsaccess: NCM component to control `/etc/hosts.allow` and `hosts.deny` files.

### DESCRIPTION

The _hostsaccess_ component manages the configuration files `/etc/hosts.allow`
and `/etc/hosts.deny`. Few checks are done on the given configuration to
allow all of the supported wildcarding.

### RESOURCES

- `/software/components/hostsaccess/allow`

    A list where each entry consists of a named list with the keys: daemon
    and host.  Both of the keys take strings as values and hence can
    support the full wildcarding syntax.  These entries are allowed to
    access the daemon.

    **NOTE:** The daemon name MUST be encoded with the pan escape()
    function. This allows daemon lists to be used in the specification.

- `/software/components/hostsaccess/deny`

    A list where each entry consists of a named list with the keys: daemon
    and host.  Both of the keys take strings as values and hence can
    support the full wildcarding syntax.  These entries are denied access
    to the daemon.

    **NOTE:** The daemon name MUST be encoded with the pan escape()
    function. This allows daemon lists to be used in the specification.

### EXAMPLE

    "/software/components/hostsaccess/allow" = append(
                                                  nlist(
                                                     "daemon",escape("slapd"),
                                                     "host","127.0.0.1"
                                                  )
                                              );
