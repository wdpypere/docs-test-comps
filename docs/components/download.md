### DESCRIPTION

Downloads files onto the local machine during the configuration,
and optionally post-processes the files.

The download is achieved by invoking `curl`,
so any URLs acceptable to `curl` (and `LWP::UserAgent`)
(including local `file://` URLs) are allowed.

A file is only downloaded if following conditions are met:

- The timestamp of the source can be retrieved
- The timestamp of the source is more recent than
the current file (if such file exists);
unless the `allow_older` attribute is set.
- The remote timestamp is not too recent.

### EXAMPLES

    "/software/components/download" = dict(
        "server", "mydownloadserver.com",
        "proto",  "http",
    );
    prefix "/software/components/download/files";
    "{/etc/passwd}" = dict(
        "href", "https://secure.my.domain",
        "post", "/usr/local/mk_passwd",
    );
    "{/usr/local/foo.txt}" = dict(
        "href", "file:///etc/foo.txt",
        "owner", "john",
        "perm", "0400",
    );
