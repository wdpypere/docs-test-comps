### NAME

symlink : symlink NCM component.

### DESCRIPTION

Object to create/delete symbolic links. When creating symlinks, target existence
can be checked. And clobbering can be disabled. Also, target definition
can be simplified by the use of contextual variables and command outputs.

### RESOURCES

- `/software/components/symlink/links`

    A list of symbolic links to create or delete.  Each entry
    must be of the `structure_symlink_entry` type which has the following
    fields:

    - `name` : symbolic link name (path).
    - `target` : link target path.

        The target path can be built using a command output with the command string
        (can include valid command options) to execute between a pair of `@@`
        or a contextual variable using the syntax `{variable}`
        (variables are defined in `/software/components/symlinks/context`).
        Unless the shell command between `@@` must be reevaluated for each link,
        it is better to associate the shell command with a contextual variable and
        use the variable in the target definition, as a contextual variable is evaluated once (global).

    - `delete` : (boolean)

        Delete the symlink (not its target) rather than creating it. `target`
        can be ommitted in this case and if present, it is not checked to be this
        value before deletion. If `exists` is true, raise an error, if the
        link is not found else just silently ignore it.

    - `exists` : (boolean)

        Check that the target exists when creating it or check that the symlink
        name exists when deleting it.

    - `replace` : (nlist)

        Option used to specify the action to take when an object with the same
        name as the symlink already exists, depending on the object type.
        Possible actions are: do not define the symlink, replace the
        object by the symlink or define the symlink after renaming the object.
        The nlist keys and values can be:

        - ** key **:

            The existing object type. Valid values are: `all`, `dir`, `dirempty`,
            `file`, `link`, `none`.  `dirempty` means an empty directory only,
            `dir` means any directory. `all` and `none` are mutually exclusive
            but can be combined with other object types to define the extension
            to use when renaming a given object type or to prevent/enable replacement
            for a specific object type.

        - ** value **:

            Action applying to the object type. Can be `yes` (replacement of the object
            by the symlink allowed), `no` (replacement of the object by the symlink
            disabled) or any other string. In this latter case, replacement of the object
            by the symlink is enabled after renaming the object by appending the string
            to its name. The value can also be empty: see below. Note that non empty
            directories are **always** renamed before defining the symlink
            (a default extension, `.ncm-symlink_saved`, is used).

    `replace` option allows a lot of flexibility in specifying what should
    be done in case of conflict with an existing object. It implements the
    following advanced features:

    - `none=extension`

        Can be used to establish a default rename extension without actually enabling
        replacement for a particular type. This extension will be used with object
        types for which replacement is enabled with `yes` rather than an extension.

    - `Action`

        Can be empty. If a default rename extension was defined with `none=extension`,
        the object will be renamed before defining the symlink. Else it is interpreted as `yes`.

- `/software/components/symlink/context`

    A list of contextual variables to use in target definitions. Each entry is
    a key/value pair with the variable name as the key. The value can contain
    a command output, as link target definition: see `target` description above.
    Contextual variables are global. They are evaluated once, before starting to define
    symlinks.

- `/software/components/symlink/options`

    A list of global options used as default for all links creation/deletion.
    Supported options are the same as options supported in the link definition
    (see above), with the exception of `delete`.

### EXAMPLES

- Define global variable osdir so that it can be use to define symlink targets

        "/software/components/symlink/context" = {
          append(nlist(
                   "name",    "ostype",
                   "value",   "@@uname@@",
          ));
        };

- Various symlink definition examples

        "/software/components/symlink/links" = {

            # Define `/usr/bin/tcsh` only if `/bin/tcsh` exists
            append(nlist(
                    "name",    "/usr/bin/tcsh",
                    "target",   "/bin/tcsh",
                    "exists",    true
            ));

            # Define `/atlas` with a target actual value including C<uname> command output
            append(nlist(
                    "name",    "/atlas",
                    "target",   "/atlas_prod/@@uname@@",
                    "exist",    true
            ));

            # Define `/lhcb` with a target actual value including a contextual variable.
            # The contextual variable can be defined before or later in the configuration.
            append(nlist(
                    "name",    "/lhcb",
                    "target",   "/lhcb_prod/{ostype}",
                    "exists",    true
            ));

            # Define `/usr/local` as a symlink only if the `/lal/prod/{ostype}` exists
            append(nlist(
                     "name",    "/usr/local",
                     "target",   "/lal_prod/{ostype}",
                     "exists",    true
            ));

            # Define symlink `/etc/alpine/conf`, replacing an existing
            # file by the symlink without renaming it
            append(nlist(
                     "name", "/etc/alpine/pine.conf",
                     "target", "/lal/gen/etc/pine.conf",
                     "replace",  nlist("all", "yes"),
            ));

            # Define symlink `/etc/pine.conf`, replacing an existing file or symlink
            # by the new symlink, after renaming it using extension .saved
            append(nlist(
                     "name", "/etc/pine.conf",
                     "target", "/lal/gen/etc/pine.conf",
                     "replace",  nlist("none", ".saved", "file", "yes", "link", "yes"),
            ));

            # Define `/htdocs` as a link only if `/htdocs` doesn't exist or already
            # exists as a symlink (actual target not checked)
            append(nlist(
                "name", "/htdocs",
                "target", HTTPD_HTDOCS_DIR,
                "replace",  nlist("all","no","link", "yes")
            ));

        # End of symlink definitions
        };

- Define options to enable replacement of empty directories and links,
with empty directories renamed adding `.saved` to their name before defining the symlink.

        "/software/components/symlink/options/replace/dirempty" = ".saved";
        "/software/components/symlink/options/replace/link" = "yes";
