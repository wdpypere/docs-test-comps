CAF
---

Common Application Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the Perl Common Application Framework (CAF) for Quattor.

It is a library encapsulating most annoying details like reporting, file handling or command executions.

It gives a unified way of doing potentially dangerous things in the right way.

Applicability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quattor developers must use modules here for:

 * Executing commands (see CAF::Process).
 * Manipulating files (see CAF::FileWriter and CAF::FileEditor).
 * Reporting. Most likely, your code receives a $self object that provided CAF's interfaces.
