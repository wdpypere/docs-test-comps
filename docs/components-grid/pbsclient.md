### NAME

NCM::pbsclient - NCM pbsclient configuration component

### SYNOPSIS

- Configure()

    Do the necessary configuration for an PBS client at CERN. The mail two configuration files
    are `/var/spool/pbs/mom`\_priv/config and `/var/spool/pbs/server`\_name. The first one is the 
    default configuration file for PBS, the second one is used to hold the PBS server name.
    In case Torque behaviour is selected, the server\_name is contained in the config file
    as well.

- Unconfigure()

    Removed the configuration file for pbs mom (but leaves the pbs server\_name file).

### RESOURCES

- `/software/components/pbsclient/active` : boolean

    activates/deactivates the component.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/cpuinfo` : string\[\]

    Defines which cpu info (from `/proc/cpuinfo`) to define as resources in the pbs\_mom config file.
    This is a string list, which may contain any processor property name that you can see in
    `/proc/cpuinfo` file.
    Two extra processor related flags can be specified : ncpus, and ncores
    ncpus is the number of physical CPUs in the node, and ncores is the total number of cores.
    \*\* All CPUs in one host are assumed to be the same \*\*

    Example properties are : "ncores", "ncpus", "flags", "model name","cpu MHz","cpu family","model","stepping"

    Properties that start with "model " or "cpu " will see this be stripped as a first step.
    All resulting pbs\_mom resources will be prefixed with cpu\_ except ncpus and ncores.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/masters` : string\[\]

    defines a list of PBS masters for this host. The first is the primary master
    for q\* commands. This directive is compulsory.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/resources` : string

    defines the PBS resources, this host provides.  This resource is currently ignored.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/restricted` : string\[\]

    defines the list of hosts that can query PBS mom for additional information using
    a reserved port (in addition to the clienthosts as set fia the masters resource).

- `/software/components/pbsclient/logEvent` : long

    Bitmask defining what log information to write to the mom\_log files.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/tmpdir` : string

    Location of the per-job transient TMPDIR directory. This resource is only
    functional on OpenPBS or Torque servers with the transient\_tmpdir patch
    applied. The default is compiled into mom.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/idealLoad` : double

    Translates into configuration directive $idealload.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/maxLoad` : double

    Translates into configuration directive $maxload.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/cpuTimeMultFactor` : double

    Translates into configuration directive $cput.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/wallTimeMultFactor` : double

    Translates into configuration directive $wallt.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/prologAlarmSec` : long

    Translates into configuration directive $prologalarm.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/checkpoint`\_interval : long
- `/software/components/pbsclient/checkpoint`\_script : string
- `/software/components/pbsclient/restart`\_script : string
- `/software/components/pbsclient/checkpoint`\_run\_exe : string
- `/software/components/pbsclient/configPath` : string

    location of the PBS mom configuration file (default: 
    `/var/spool/pbs/mom`\_priv/config).  Note that the server\_name file is 
    written two directories up (thus by default in `/var/spool/pbs`).

- `/software/components/pbsclient/behaviour` : string

    The way the server\_name is conveyed to PBS mom. The default is
    OpenPBS, where the name is written to the file "server\_name". The
    only other valid value is "Torque", where the name is written
    in the "$pbsservername" directive in the mom config file.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/nodeCheckScriptPath` : string
- `/software/components/pbsclient/nodeCheckIntervalSec` : long
- `/software/components/pbsclient/initScriptPath` : string

    Name of the init.d script to run in the configuration changed. BY
    default this is "/etc/init.d/pbs".

- `/software/components/pbsclient/directPaths` : component\_pbsclient\_pathmapping\_type\[\]

    Locations that are accesible directly using the POSIX FileIO calls (i.e. without
    using pbs\_rcp). This array of records define dthe list of $usecp directives.
    The component\_pbsclient\_pathmapping\_type contains two resources ("locations" and "path").

- `/software/components/pbsclient/scripts/prologue` : string
=item `/software/components/pbsclient/scripts/epilogue` : string
=item `/software/components/pbsclient/scripts/prologue.user` : string
=item `/software/components/pbsclient/scripts/epilogue.user` : string
=item `/software/components/pbsclient/scripts/prologue.parallel` : string

    These scripts may be defined to augment the behavior of pbs when
    starting and ending jobs.  See the pbs documentation for a complete
    description of when each script runs and as what user.

- `/software/components/pbsclient/submitonly` ? boolean

    If true, it assumes this host is only used for job submission, and has no pbs MOM running
     that requires restarting.
