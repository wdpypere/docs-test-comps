### NAME

lcas: NCM component to manage LCAS configuration file(s)

### DESCRIPTION

The _lcas_ component writes the LCAS configuration file(s). The
primary file is the LCAS database, listing the plugin modules
to be called (in the order specified in the profile).

Optionally, it can write the module configuration files as well
(as just plain files, one line for every entry in the content
list). The header can be suppressed, if ever there is a module
that chokes on the pound-sign comments at the top.

The _lcas_ component can manage several different LCAS databases and associated module
configuration files.
