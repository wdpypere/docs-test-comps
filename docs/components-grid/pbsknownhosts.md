### NAME

The _pbsknownhosts_ component manages the configuration file
for the edg-pbs-knownhosts script. 

### DESCRIPTION

The _pbsknownhosts_ component manages the configuration file for the
edg-pbs-knownhosts script. 

### RESOURCES

#### configfile (/opt/edg/etc/edg-pbs-knownhosts.conf)

The location of the configuration file.  Normally this should not be
changed. 

#### pbsbin (/usr/bin)

The path to the pbs executables. 

#### nodes ()

Space-separated list of additional nodes to add to known hosts
configuration file.  The default is the empty list. 

#### keytypes (rsa1,rsa,dsa)

The types of ssh keys to generate.  

#### knownhosts (/etc/ssh/ssh\_known\_hosts)

The ssh known hosts file to update. 

#### knownhostsscript (/opt/edg/sbin/edg-pbs-knownhosts)

The script to run for generating the known hosts.

#### targets (optional, string\[\])

Specify what configuration files should be generated. The default
is to generate a configuration for edg-pbs-knownhosts only, but
is can be set to also - or alternatively - generate the 
configuration for edg-pbs-shostsequiv.

The value is an array of strings that specify the disired 
behaviour: "pbsknownhosts/targets" = list("pbsknownhosts") will
generate the edg-pbs-knownhosts config only; "pbsknownhosts/targets" = 
list("shostsequiv") will generate edg-pbs-shostsequiv config only;
and "pbsknownhosts/targets" = list("pbsknownhosts","shostsequiv") will
generate both.

#### shostsConfigFile (optional, `/opt/edg/etc/edg`-pbs-shostsequiv.conf)

should not be changed.
