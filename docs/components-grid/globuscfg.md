### NAME

globuscfg: Configure Globus services.

### DESCRIPTION

The _globuscfg_ component configures the globus services.  It manages 
the `/etc/sysconfig/globus` and globus configuration files.  In
addition, it will start the specified Globus services.

### RESOURCES

- `/software/components/globuscfg/sysconfigUpdate` : boolean

    If false, `/etc/sysconfig/globus` is not updated. Must be set to
    false if you want to manage `/etc/sysconfig/globus` with another component
    (e.g. ncm-sysconfig).

    D : true

- `/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS`\_LOCATION

    The root of the Globus software tree.  By default this is `/opt/globus.`

- `/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS`\_CONFIG

    The full path to the Globus configuration file.  Defaults to
    `/etc/globus.conf`. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/globus`\_flavor\_name

    The globus "flavor" to use.  There is no default.  A typical value is
    gcc32dbg. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/services`

    The list of Globus services to restart after a configuration.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/x509`\_user\_cert
- `/software/components/globuscfg/x509`\_user\_key

    The path to the host certificate and key.  These have no default as
    there are some machines which do not require the security
    infrastructure to be installed.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridmap`

    The path to the grid-mapfile.  This has no default as there are some
    machines which do not require the security infrastructure to be
    installed.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS`\_TCP\_PORT\_RANGE

    The port range that the gatekeeper and gridftp will use to open
    up listening services for inbound tcp connections. eg 50000,52000

- `/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS`\_UDP\_PORT\_RANGE

    The port range that the gatekeeper and gridftp will use to open
    up listening services for inbound udp connections. eg 50000,52000

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridmapdir`

    The path to the grid-mapfile. This has no default as there are some
    machines which do not require the security infrastructure to be
    installed.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/globus`\_flavor\_name

    The globus "flavor" to use for MDS will use global value unless specified.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/user`

    The user with which to run the MDS daemons (default: root).

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/x509`\_user\_cert
- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/x509`\_user\_key

    The path to the certificate and key to use for MDS. Host credentials
    will be used if not specified. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/gris/suffix` 

    The suffix to use for the GRISes.  Defaults to "\\"Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid\\"". 
    Double quotes MUST appear as part of the value. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/gris/provider`

    A table of GRIS information providers to run within the MDS. By
    default the name of each provider is the name of the info provider
    executable (in the default area), so for example in the case of

    "/software/components/globuscfg/mds/gris/provider/xyz"=""

-

    "xyz" will be taken, as the name of the executable. 
    You may optionally specify a
    fully-qualified executable name to override this default. The
    parameter to set is, for example, "provider\_edg" for the edg
    information provider.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/gris/registration`

    The _list_ of GIISes to which the GRISes should register, so it
    has entries labelled with numbers. These entries are have 
    further entries like
    _regname_, _reghost_, _regport_, _regperiod_, and _ttl_. These
    are optional; default values of these parameters can be changed
    this using them. The _regperiod_ and
    _ttl_ should be specified as a pair with _ttl_ at least twice that
    of _regperiod_. The name of
    the GIIS defaults entry _recordname_, which is obligatory for
    every element. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/allowedregs`

    The _list_ of local GIISes to run. As for lists, entries which
    represent GIISes have numbers as names. They have an obligatory
    field (_recordname_), the identifier name of the entry. This 
    will be taken as the default value for _name_ parameter, but can be 
    overriden by specifying this one explicitly. See example.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/allowedregs`/&lt;number>/allowreg

    The list of allowed host:port pairs which may register to this
    giis. This is a sub-parameter of the giis.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration`

    To register a local GIIS to another GIIS specify explicitly at least
    the _regname_ sub-parameter.  Additionally, you may also specify
    _reghost_, _regport_, _regperiod_ and _ttl_.  The parameter _reghost_ is
    required for a remote GIIS.  Either the same tag as on the giis line
    must be used, or the tag variable can be specified.

    Multiple registrations for a local GIIS can be done by creating a
    dummy entry and explicitly specifying the tag and _name_
    parameters.

    The _regperiod_ and _ttl_ should be specified as a pair with _ttl_ 
    at least twice that of _regperiod_.  

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/globus`\_flavour\_name

    The globus "flavor" to use for GridFTP will use global value unless
    specified.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/X509`\_USER\_CERT
- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/X509`\_USER\_KEY

    The path to the certificate and key to use for GridFTP.  Host credentials
    will be used if not specified. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/ftpd`

    The full path to the GridFTP daemon.  Normally this is not specified
    as the default is usually correct. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/port`

    The port number to use for the GridFTP daemon.  The default is 2811.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/umask`

    The umask to use for the GridFTP daemon.  The default is 002. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/log`

    The full path to the log file for the GridFTP daemon.  This defaults
        to the area `/var/log.`

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/user`

    The user with which to run the GridFTP daemon.  Will default to root.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/options`

    This will override all options for the GridFTP daemon.  Use only if
    you really know what you are doing.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/globus`\_gatekeeper

    The executable name for the gatekeeper.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/extra`\_options

    Additional options to pass to the gatekeeper.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/globus`\_flavor\_name

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/port`

    The port to use for the gatekeeper.  (This defaults to 2119 if not
    specified.) 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/logfile`

    The location of the log file for the daemon. (Default depends on
    whether user is specified.)

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers`

    The _list_ of job managers to use for this gatekeeper.  The fork job
    manager is required (and required to be the default), so only non-fork
    job managers need to be specified. 

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers`/&lt;entryNo>/recordname

    Obligatory parameter, identifier string for a certain job manager.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers`/&lt;entryNo>/type

    Name of job manager executable.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers`/&lt;entryNo>/job\_manager\_path

    Path to the job manager executable.  Only needs to be specified if it
    is in a non-standard location.

- `/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers`/&lt;entryNo>/extra\_config

### EXAMPLE

"/software/components/globuscfg/globus\_flavor\_name" = "gcc32dbg";

"/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS\_LOCATION" = "/opt/globus";

"/software/components/globuscfg/GLOBUS\_CONFIG" = "/etc/globus.conf";

"/software/components/globuscfg/services" = 
list(" globus-mds", "globus-gridftp");

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/user" = "mdsuser";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gris/provider/globus-gris" = "";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gris/provider/othergrid" = 
					"/opt/othergrid/othergrid.info";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gris/registration/0/recordname" =  "local";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gris/registration/0/regname" =  "localreg";

"/software/components/globuscfg/giis/allowedregs/0/recordname" =  "local";

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/allowedregs/0/allowreg" = "hostname:port";

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/name" = "local";

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/regname" = "somecountry";

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/reghost" = 
"giis.someplace.com";

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/regport" = 2135;

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/regperiod" = 40;

"/software/components/globuscfg/mds/giis/registration/remote/ttl"= 40;

"/software/components/globuscfg/gridftp/user" = "ftpuser";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers/0/recordname" = "JobManager";

"/software/components/globuscfg/gatekeeper/jobmanagers/0/extra\_config" = "extra\_configs";

This changes the default location of the Globus software and tells the
component to manage the MDS and GridFTP daemons.  Two information
providers (GRISes) are configured which register with the "local"
GIIS.  The local GIIS then registers with the given remote GIIS.  The
user with which to run the GridFTP daemon is set to ftpuser while the
one for MDS is mdsuser.
