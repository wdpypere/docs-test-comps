### NAME

mkgridmap:  NCM component to configure edg-mkgridmap.conf for mkgridmap.

### DESCRIPTION

The _mkgridmap_ component manages the configuration file (e.g. `/opt/edg/etc/edg`-mkgridmap.conf) for mkgridmap.
It can handle several mapfiles and support two distinct mapfile format : 

- edg : the traditional format associating DNs with pool accounts
- lcgdm : a mapfile to associate DNs to VO name. It is used by LCG products like DPM and LFC to handle
authorization for users not authenticated with VOMS (grid-proxy-init or voms-proxy-init without -voms).

### RESOURCES

#### entries : nlist

A nlist of mapfile entries. The name of the entry is informational only. The entry resources are described
below.

#### lcmaps : nlist (optional)

This nlist describes lcmaps gridmapfile and groupmapfile to update. The entry resources are described
below.

#### voList : list (optional)

This list specifies the VO to process, and the order in which they will appear. If not present or undefined, defaults to all VOs defined in the configuration (/system/vo), sorted by name.

### LCMAPS RESOURCES

#### flavor : string 

This property indicates LCMAPS gridmapfile/groupmafile format. It can be 'edg' or 'glite'. When format is 'glite', FQANs 
are taken literally from configuration : they must be valid VOMS FQAN in standard format. When format is 'edg', FQANs
in configuration are converted into EDG format (/VO=vo\_name/GROUP=.../ROLE=...).

Default : glite (no conversion)

#### lcmaps/gridmapfile : string (required)

The full path to the LCMAPS gridmapfile.

Default : `/opt/edg/etc/lcmaps/gridmapfile`

#### lcmaps/groupmapfile : string (required)

The full path to the LCMAPS groupmapfile.

Default : `/opt/edg/etc/lcmaps/groupmapfile`

### MAPFILE ENTRY RESOURCES

#### mkgridmapconf

The location of the edg-mkgridmap.conf file, by default
`/opt/edg/etc/edg`-mkgridmap.conf

#### command

The command to run to regenerate the gridmap file.  If provided, this
command will be run whenever changes to the configuration occur. 

#### groups

A list of group entries in the edg-mkgridmap.conf file. For each group
uri\_&lt;group> and user\_&lt;group> can be defined to specify the collection
of users at a URI that should be mapped to a particular user.

#### auths

A list of auth entries in the edg-mkgridmap.conf file. For each auth line
a uri\_&lt;auth> should be defined.

#### lcuser

What the lcuser should be defined as.

#### allow

A pattern match of certs that should be permitted in the grid-mapfile.

#### deny

A pattern match of certs that should be denied in the grid-mapfile.

Note the allow allways occurs, if it is defined at all, in the mkgridmap.conf
file before the deny rule. Read man edg-mkgridmap.conf for the consequences of
this.

#### gmflocal

One or more local grid-mapfile(s) to be imported in the generated grid-mapfile, where they will override
other entries. By default &lt;edgcfg.location>/etc/grid-mapfile-local. The entry
can be either a string (default), or a list of strings (in which case the existing entry will have to
be null-ified beforehand).

#### overwrite

By default set to yes. If set to no the local grid-mapfile will not be
overwritten if it already exists.

#### locals

A list for which each element has the values of cert\_&lt;local> and 
user\_&lt;local>. This will add mappings to the (first) grid-mapfile-local defined
above.
