### NAME

Test::Quattor::TextRender::Metaconfig - Class for unittesting
the [metaconfig](../components/metaconfig.md) services and their templates.

### DESCRIPTION

This class should be used to unittest ncm-metaconfig
services and their templates.

To be used as

    my $u = Test::Quattor::TextRender::Metaconfig->new(
        service => 'logstash',
        version => '1.2',
        )->test();

The tests require access to the `template-library-core`
repository for using standard types in the schema files.

By default, the `template-library-core` is expected to be in the
same directory as the one this test is being ran from.
One can also specify the location via the `QUATTOR_TEST_TEMPLATE_LIBRARY_CORE`
environment variable.
