### NAME

Test::Quattor::RegexpTest - Class to handle a single regexptest.

### DESCRIPTION

This class parses and executes the tests as described in a single regexptest.

#### Public methods

- new

    Returns a new object, accepts the following options

    - regexp

        The regexptest file.

    - text

        The text to test.

#### parse

Parse the regexp file in 3 sections: description, flags and tests.

Each section is converted in an instance attribute named 'description',
 'flags' and 'tests'.

#### parse\_description

Parse the description block and set the description attribute.

First argument `blocktxt` is the 1st block of the regexptest file.

#### parse\_flags

Parse the flags block and set `flags` attribute

Following flags are supported

- regular expression flags:
    - multiline

        (no)multiline / multiline=1/0

    - singleline

        singleline / singleline=1/0

        (This flag can coexist with multiline)

    - extended format

        extended / extended=1/0

    - case senistive

        case(in)sensistive / casesensitive = 0/1
- order flag
    - ordered matches

        (un)ordered / ordered=0/1
- negate

    negate / negate = 0/1

    Negate all regexps, none of the regexps can match
    (is an alias for `COUNT 0` on every regtest;
     overwritten when COUNT is set for individual regexp)

- quote

    quote / quote = 0/1

    Whole tests block is 1 regular expression. With `quote` flag set,
    `multiline` flag is logged and ignored; `ordered` flag is
    meaningless (and silently ignored).

- location of module and contents settings:
    - metaconfigservice=/some/path

        Also any flag starting with `/` is interpreted as `metaconfigservice`

    - renderpath=/some/path

        Also any flag starting with `//` is interpreted as `renderpath`

    - rendermodule

        Specify the value of the module to use. (Precedes
        metaconfigservice/renderpath value).

    - contentspath

        Specify the path to use for contents. (Precedes
        metaconfigservice/renderpath value).

    - element

        Comma separated list of predefined element convert options for CCM::TextRender.
- Default settings

        ordered=1
        multiline=1
        casesensitive=1
        renderpath=/metaconfig

First argument `blocktxt` is the 2nd block of the regexptest file.

#### parse\_tests

Parse the tests block and set `tests` attribute

If the `quote` flag is set, the whole tests block is
seen as one big regular expression, and rendered text
has to be an exact match, incl EOF newline etc.

Without the `quote` flag set, the tests are parsed line by line,
and seen as one regexp per line.

Lines starting with `\s*#{3} ` (trailing space!) are comments.

Lines ending with `\s#{3}` are interpreted as having options set.
Supported options

- COUNT

    `COUNT \d+` is the exact number of matches
    (use `COUNT 0 `to make sure a line doesn't match).

    This is a global count, e.g. in ordered mode the count
    itself is not number of matches since previous test match.

The first argument `blocktxt` is the 3rd block of the regexptest file

#### test

Perform the tests as defined in the flags and specified in the 'tests' section
