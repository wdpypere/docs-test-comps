### NAME

Test::Quattor::TextRender - Class for unittesting
the TextRender templates.

### DESCRIPTION

This class should be used whenever to unittest templates
that can be processed via TextRender. (For testing ncm-metaconfig
templates looked at the derived Test::Quattor::TextRender::Metaconfig
class).

#### Public methods

- new

    Returns a new object, accepts the following options

    - basepath

        Basepath that points to the templates.

    - ttpath

        Path to the TT files.
        If the path is not absolute, search from basepath.

    - panpath

        Path to the (mandatory) pan templates.
        If the path is not absolute, search from basepath.

    - pannamespace

        Namespace for the (mandatory) pan templates. (Use empty
        string for no namespace).

    - namespacepath

        Destination directory to create a copy of the pan templates
        in correct namespaced directory. Relative paths are assumed
        relative to the current working directory.

        If no value is set, a random directory will be used.

    - panunfold

        Boolean to force or disable the "unfolding" of the pan templates
        in the namespacepath with correct pannamespace. Default is true.

        The `make_namespace` method  takes care of the actual unfolding (if any).

    - expect

        Expect is a hash reference to bypass some built-in tests
        in the test methods.

        Use with care, better to fix the actual problem.
        (No attempt is made to make this any userfriendly;
        main reason of existence is to unittest
        these test modules).

    - invalidtt

        Array reference of invalid TT files to pass the `test_gather_tt` test method.

    - invalidpan

        Array reference of invalid pan templates to pass the `test_gather_pan` test method.

#### gather\_tt

Walk the `ttpath` and gather all TT files
A TT file is a text file with an `.tt` extension;
they are considered 'invalid' when they are
in a 'test' or 'pan' directory or
when they fail syntax validation.

Returns an arrayreference with path
(relative to the basepath) of TT and invalid TT files.

#### test\_gather\_tt

Run tests based on gather\_tt results; returns nothing.

#### gather\_pan

Same as Test::Quattor::Object `gather_pan`, but with &lt;relpath> set
to the instance 'basepath'. (With `panpath` and `pannamespace` as arguments)

#### make\_namespace

Create a copy of the gathered pan files from `panpath` in the correct `pannamespace`.
Directory structure is build up starting from the instance `namespacepath` value.

Returns an arrayreference with the copy locations.

If the `panunfold` attribute is true, a copy of the pan templates is placed
in the expected subdirectory under the `namespacepath`.
If `panunfold` attribute is false, the pan templates are assumed to be in the
correct location, and nothing is done.

#### test\_gather\_pan

Run tests based on gather\_pan results; returns nothing.

(`panpath` and `pannamespace` can be passed as arguments to
override the instance values).
