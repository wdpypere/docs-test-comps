### NAME

Test::Quattor::TextRender::Suite - Class for a template test suite.

### DESCRIPTION

A TextRender test suite corresponds to one or more
regexptests that are tested against the profile genereated
from one corresponding object template.

A test suite can be a combination of file (implying one regexptest, and that
file being the regexptest) and/or a directory
(one or more regexptests; each file in the directory is one
regexptest; no subdirectory structure allowed);
with the file or directory name
identical to the corresponding object template.

The names cannot start with a '.'.

    used as regular expression pattern for the filter.
