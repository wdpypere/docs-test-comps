### NAME

Test::Quattor::TextRender::Base - Base class for unittesting
the templates in [metaconfig](../components/metaconfig.md) and components.

Refer to the specialized Test::Quattor::TextRender::Metaconfig and
Test::Quattor::TextRender::Component for actual usage.

#### test

Run all unittests to validate a set of templates.

#### mock\_textrender

An exported function that mocks `CAF::TextRender`
to test usage of TT files during regular component use
in unittests. During this phase, `CAF::TextRender` has to use
TT files that are being tested, not the ones installed.
(`CAF::TextRender` has no easy way to do this to
avoid spreading TT files around).

It takes an optional argument `includepath` and sets this
as the includepath of `CAF::TextRender`. The default includepath
is `target/share/templates/quattor`, where the TT files are
staged during testing via maven (use exported `$TARGET_TT_DIR`).

To be used as

    use Test::Quattor::TextRender::Base;
    mock_textrender();

It returns the mock instance. (This is for convenience, you shouldn't
need this (except maybe to `unmock_all`?). `Test::MockModule`
keeps a cache of mocked instances, a new call would return the same
instance.)
