This class provides the neccessary support functions for components,
which have to inherit from it.

Public methods

- warn
 
 Report with loglevel 'WARN'. Increases the number of
 reported warnings in the \ ``WARNINGS``\  attribute by 1.
 
 (The ncd client will report the number of warnings reported by the component.)
 


- error
 
 Report with loglevel 'ERROR'. Increases the number of
 reported errors in the \ ``ERRORS``\  attribute by 1.
 
 (The ncd client will report the number of errors reported by the component.
 The component will therefore be flagged as
 failed, and no depending components will be executed.)
 


- name
 
 Returns the component name
 


- prefix
 
 Returns the standard configuration path for the component
 \ ``</software/components/<name``\ >>.
 


- get_warnings(): integer
 
 Returns the number of calls to 'warn' by the component.
 


- get_errors(): integer
 
 Returns the number of calls to 'error' by the component.
 


- event
 
 Add an event to the history (if exists). Following metadata is added
 
 
 - component
  
  The component name

 Returns arrayref with reported event indices.
 


- set_active_config
 
 Set \ ``config``\  as the \ ``ACTIVE_CONFIG``\  attribute.
 
 Returns the current active config.
 


- get_tree
 
 Return \ ``EDG::WP4::CCM::Configuration-``\ getTree> on the \ ``ACTIVE_CONFIG``\  attribute.
 
 All arguments are passed to \ ``getTree``\ .
 
 If no arguments are specified, the path passed to \ ``getTree``\  is
 the component prefix (using the \ ``prefix``\  method).
 
 If the path specified is not absolute, the path passed to \ ``getTree``\  is
 prefixed with the component prefix (using the \ ``prefix``\  method).
 
 Returns undef on failure, with \ ``fail``\  attribute set in case of an error.
 
 (Requires active configuration set).
 


- get_fqdn
 
 Return the fqdn based on the current active config.
 
 This is either \ ``/system/network/realhostname``\  (if defined)
 or \ ``</system/network/hostname>.</system/network/domainname>``\ .
 
 (Requires active configuration set).
