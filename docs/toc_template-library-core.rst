Templates for configuring a specific Quattor release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository provides all the templates required to configure a specific version of the Quattor client and the related configuration modules used by other parts of the template library. There is one tag per Quattor version.

This repository is intended to be used in conjunction with other parts of the template library (standard, os, grid...) to actually configure a system. To help putting together everything needed in a way directly usable in a real configuration, it is recommended to follow this procedure_.

*Note: despite what suggest the script name/location, it is recommended to use this script whether you are using SCDB or not to get all parts of the template library organized in a proper way.*
