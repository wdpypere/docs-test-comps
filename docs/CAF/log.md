### NAME

CAF::Log - Simple class for handling log files

### SYNOPSIS

    use CAF::Log;

    my $log = CAF::Log->new('/foo/bar', 'at');

    $log->print("this goes to the log file\n");
    $log->close();

### DESCRIPTION

The **CAF::Log** class allows to instantiate objects for writing log files.
A log file line can be prefixed by a time stamp.

#### Public methods

- `close()`: boolean

    closes the log file, returns SUCCESS on success, undef otherwise
    (if no FH attribute exists).

- `print($msg)`: boolean

    Prints `$msg` into the log file.

    If `PROCID` attribute is defined (value is irrelevant),
    the proces id in square brackets (`[PID]`) and additional
    space are prepended.

    If `TSTAMP` attribute is defined (value is irrelevant),
    a `YYYY/MM/DD-HH:mm:ss` timestamp and additional space
    are prepended.

    No newline is added to the message.

    Returns the return value of invocation of FH print method.

#### Private methods

- `_initialize($filename, $options)`

    `$options` is a string with magic letters

    - a: append to a logfile
    - w: truncate a logfile
    - t: generate a timestamp on every print
    - p: add PID

    Only one of `w` or `a` can and has to be set. (There is no default.)

    If the `w` option is used and there was a previous
    log file, it is renamed with the extension '.prev'.

    Examples:
        CAF::Log->new('/foo/bar', 'at'): append, enable timestamp
        CAF::Log->new('/foo/bar', 'w') : truncate logfile, no timestamp

    If the filename ends with `.log`, the `SYSLOG` attribute is set to
    basename of the file without suffix (relevant for **CAF::Reporter::syslog**).

- DESTROY

    Called during garbage collection. Invokes close().
