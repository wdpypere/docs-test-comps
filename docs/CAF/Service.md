### NAME

CAF::Service - Class for starting and stopping daemons in different
platforms

### SYNOPSIS

    use CAF::Service;
    my $srv = CAF::Service->new(['ntpd'], log => $self, %opts);
    $srv->reload();
    $srv->stop();
    $srv->start();
    $srv->restart();
    $srv->stop_sleep_start();

Will do the right thing with SystemV Init scripts, Systemd units and
Solaris' `svcadm`.

### DESCRIPTION

This class abstracts away the differences when operating with Daemons
in different Unixes.

#### Private methods

- `_initialize`

    Initialize the process object. Arguments:

    - `$services`

        Reference to a list of services to be handled.

    It takes some extra optional arguments:

    - `log`

        A [Reporter](../CAF/Reporter.md) object to log daemon activities to.

    - `timeout`

        Maximum execution time, in seconds, for any service operations. If
        it's too slow it will be killed.  If not defined, the command won't
        time out.

        On Solaris it implies that `svcadm` actions are executed
        synchronously.  After this timeout, the operation will continue in
        background, but will NOT mark the service as failed.  For marking
        timed out services operations as failed, we have to edit the method
        definition, which is out of the scope of this method.  See the man
        page for smf\_method for more details.

        On systemd-based systems, the timeout parameter is ignored.  The
        correct way to handle timeouts in systemd is to store them in the unit
        file, which will ensure they are respected in any context that unit
        may be called.

    - `sleep`.

        Used only in `stop_sleep_start`. Determines the number of
        seconds to sleep after `stop` before proceeding with `start`.

    - `persistent`

        Used only in the Solaris variant of `start` and `stop`.  Make the
        enabling or disabling of this service persist in subsequent reboots.
        Implies not passing the `-t` flag to `svcadm`.

    - `recursive`.

        Used only in the Solaris variant of `start` and `stop`.  Starts or
        stops all the dependencies for the given daemons, too.

    - `synchronous`

        Used only in the Solaris variant of `restart`.  Waits until all
        services have been restarted.

        If no `timeout` was passed, it will wait forever.

    ...

#### Public methods

- `restart`

    Restarts the daemons.

- `start`

    Starts the daemons.

- `stop`

    Stops the daemons

- `reload`

    Reloads the daemons

- `stop_sleep_start`

    Stops the daemon, sleep, and then start the dameon again.
    Only when both `stop` and `start` are successful, return success.

- os\_flavour

    Determine and return the OS flavour (/variant)

    Current flavours are

    - linux\_sysv

        Linux OS with SysV int system

    - linux\_systemd

        Linux OS with systemd

    - solaris

        Solaris OS

    (All supported flavours are exported via `@FLAVOURS`.)

#### Private methods

- \_\_make\_method

    A generator for service methods, to be used in e.g.
    subclassing. In the example below we create a custom service
    class that supports e.g. 'service myservice init':

        package MyService;

        use CAF::Service qw(__make_method @FLAVOURS);
        use parent qw(CAF::Service);

        sub _initialize {
            my ($self, %opts) = @_;
            return $self->SUPER::_initialize(['myservice'], %opts);
        }

        my $method = 'init';
        foreach my $flavour (@FLAVOURS) {
            no strict 'refs';
            *{"${method}_${flavour}"} = __make_method($method, $flavour);
            use strict 'refs';
        }

        1;

    This class can than be used in the same way as `CAF::Service`

        use MyService;
        ...
        my $serv = MyService->new();
        $serv->init();
        ...
        $serv->reload();
