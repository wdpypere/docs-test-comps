### NAME

CAF::Object - provides basic methods for all CAF objects

### SYNOPSIS

    use parent qw(CAF::Object ...);
    ...
    sub _initialize {
        ... initialize your package
        return SUCCESS; # Success
    }

### DESCRIPTION

**CAF::Object** is a base class which provides basic functionality to
CAF objects.

All other CAF objects should inherit from it.

All CAF classes use this as their base class and inherit their class
constructor `new` from here. Sub-classes should implement all their
constructor initialisation in an `_initialize` method which is invoked
from this base class `new` constructor. Sub-classes should NOT need to
override the `new` class method.

The subclass `_initialize` method has to be implemented
and has to return a boolean value indicating if the initialisation was succesful
(e.g. use `SUCCESS` exported by `CAF::Object`).
In particular, one should avoid to return the `$self` instance at the end of
`_initialize` (e.g. to avoid troubles when the subclass overloads logic evaluation
(which is also possible via overloading other methods such as stringification)).

#### Public methods

- new

    Creates an empty hash and bless'es it as the new class instance. All arguments are then passed
    to a `$self-`\_initialize(@\_)> call.
    When `_initialize` returns success, the `NoAction` attribute is set to the value of
    `CAF::Object::NoAction` if it didn't exist after `_initialize`.
    If `_initialize` returns failure, an error is thrown and undef returned.

- noAction

    Returns the NoAction flag value (boolean)

#### Private methods

- \_initialize

    This method must be overwritten in a derived class

- error, warn, info, verbose, debug, report, OK, event

    Convenience methods to access the log/reporter instance that might
    be passed during initialisation and set to `$self-`{log}>.

    (When constructing classes via multiple inheritance,
    [Reporter](../CAF/Reporter.md) should precede `CAF::Object` if you want
    to use an absolute rather than a conditional logger).

- fail

    Handle failures. Stores the error message in the `fail` attribute,
    logs it with `verbose` and returns undef.

    To be used in subclasses that are not supposed to log/report
    any errors themself when a problem or failure occurs.
    In such classes, all failures should use `return $self-`fail("message");>.

- update\_env

    Update the hashref `$env` with key/value
    from the `ENV` attribute hashref.
    (A undef value will remove the key.)

    Returns the `env` hashref.

    To be used as
        # Setup local environment
        local %ENV = %ENV;
        $self->update\_env(\\%ENV);

    Example:
        # some method\_1 that prepares a shared environment
        sub method\_1
        {
            ...
            # Prepare enviroment modifications
            $self->{ENV}->{PATH} = "/some/new/path:$ENV{PATH}";
            ...
        }

        sub do_something
        {
           ...
           # Setup local environment
           local %ENV = %ENV;
           $self->update_env(\%ENV);

           # everything in the remainder of the method runs in modified environment
           # is limited to the scope of this method due to 'local'
           ...
        }
