### DESCRIPTION

This module implements a rule-based editor that is used to modify the content
of an existing file. Each rule driving the editing process is applied to all
lines wose "keyword" is matching the one specified in the rule. The input for
updating the file is a hash typically built from the Quattor configuration when
the rule-based editor is called from a configuration module. Conditions can be defined
based on the contents of this configuration. Lines in the configuration file
that don't match any rule are kept unmodified.

This module is a subclass of the **CAF::FileEditor**: it extends the base methods of
the **CAF::FileEditor**. It has only one public method (it uses the **CAF::FileEditor** constructor).
The methods provided in this module can be combined with **CAF::FileEditor**
methods to edit a file.

Rules used to edit the file are defined in a hash: each entry (key/value pair) defines a rule.
Multiple rules can be applied to the same file: it is important that they are
orthogonal, else the result is unpredictable. The order used to apply rules is the alphabetical
order of keywords. Applying the rules to the same configuration always give the same result
but the changes are not necessarily idempotent (order in which successive edits occured
may matter, depending on the actual rules).

The hash entry key represents the line keyword in configuration file and
hash value is the parsing rule for the keyword value. Parsing rule format is :

      [condition->]option_name:option_set[,option_set,...];line_fmt[;value_fmt[:value_fmt_opt]]

If the line keyword (hash key) starts with a '-', the matching
configuration line will be removed/commented out (instead of added/updated) from the
configuration file if present. If it starts with a '?', the
matching line will be removed/commented out if the option is undefined.

- condition

    An option or an option set/subset (see below) that must exist for the rule to be applied
    or the keyword `ALWAYS`.
    Both `option_set` and `option_name:option_set` are accepted. option and option set
    in the condition are normally different from the `option_name` and `option_set`
    parameters in the rule as this is the default behaviour to apply the rule only if
    they exist. One option set only is allowed and only its existence (not its value) is tested.

    `option_set` can be either an actual option set as defined below or a subset of an option set
    (a subhash of the option set hash). To specify a subset, use `/` as a level separator, 
    e.g. `xroot/securityProtocol/gsi` (`gsi` subet of `securityProtocol` subset of `xroot` option set).

    It is possible to negate the condition (option or option\_set must not exist)
    by prepending it with '!'.

    `ALWAYS` is a special condition that means that rules must be applied whether
    the `option_name:option_set` exist in the configuration or not. When they don't exist
    the result is to comment out the matching configuration lines.

- option\_name

    The name of an option that will be retrieved from the configuration. An option is
    a key in the option set hash.

- option\_set

    The name of an option set where the option is located in (for example 'dpnsHost:dpm'
    means `dpnsHost` option of `dpm` option set). An option set is a sub-hash in the configuration
    hash. `GLOBAL` is a special value for `option_set` indicating that the option is a global option,
    instead of belonging to a specific option set (global options are at the top level of the configuration
    hash).

- line\_fmt

    Defines the format used to represent the keyword/value pair. Several format are supported covering
    the most usual ones (SH shell script, Apache, ...). For the exact list, see the definition of
    LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants and the associated documentation below.

- value\_fmt

    used to indicate how to interpret the configuration value. It is used mainly for
    boolean values, list and hashes. See LINE\_VALUE\_xxx constants below for the possible values.

- value\_fmt

    used to indicate how to interpret the configuration value. It is used mainly for
    boolean values, list and hashes. See LINE\_VALUE\_xxx constants below for the possible values.

An example of rule declaration is:

    my %dpm_config_rules_2 = (
        "ALLOW_COREDUMP" => "allowCoreDump:dpm;".LINE_FORMAT_SH_VAR.";".LINE_VALUE_BOOLEAN,
        "GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL" => "globusThreadModel:dpm;".LINE_FORMAT_ENV_VAR,
        "DISKFLAGS" =>"DiskFlags:dpm;".LINE_FORMAT_SH_VAR.";".LINE_VALUE_ARRAY,
       );

For more comprehensive examples of rules, look at **ncm-dpmlfc** or **ncm-xrootd** source code in
configuration-modules-grid repository.

#### Rule Constants

The constants described here are used to build the rules. All these
constants are exported. Add the following to use them:

    use RuleBasedEditor qw(:rule_constants);

There is a different group of constants for each part of the rule.

### LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx: general syntax of the line

- LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL:        keyword value (e.g. Xrootd, Apache)

    keywork/value separator can be customized with `LINE_VALUE_OPT_SEP_xxx`. No coment is added
    to the line.

    This is the default line format.

- LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL\_SET:    set keyword value

    Same remarks as for LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL.

- LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL\_SETENV:    setenv keyword value

    Same remarks as for LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL.

- LINE\_FORMAT\_ENV\_VAR:        export keyword=value (e.g. SH shell family). A comment is added at the
end of the line if it is modified by **CAF::RuleBasedEditor**. If the value contains whitespaces, it
is quoted.
- LINE\_FORMAT\_SH\_VAR:         keyword=value (e.g. SH shell family). A comment is added at the
end of the line if it is modified by **CAF::RuleBasedEditor**. If the value contains whitespaces, it
is quoted.

Inline comments are not supported for the LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL\_xxx formats.

### LINE\_VALUE\_xxx: how to interpret the configuration value

- LINE\_VALUE\_AS\_IS: take the value as it is, do not attempt any conversion.

    This is the default value type.

- LINE\_VALUE\_BOOLEAN: interpret the value as a boolean rendered as `yes` or `no`.
- LINE\_VALUE\_ARRAY: the value is an array. Rendering controlled by LINE\_OPT\_xxx constants.
- LINE\_VALUE\_HASH: the value is a hash of strings. Rendering controlled by LINE\_OPT\_xxx constants.
- LINE\_VALUE\_HASH\_KEYS: the value is a hash whose keys are the value. Rendering similar to arrays with 
`LINE_VALUE_ARRAY` (the key list is treated as an array).
- LINE\_VALUE\_INSTANCE\_PARAMS: specific to **ncm-xrootd**

### LINE\_OPT\_xxx: options for rendering the config line

These options mainly apply to lists and hashes and are interpreted as a bitmask.

- LINE\_OPT\_KEY\_PREFIX\_DASH: if set, add a `-` before the keyword when writing it in the configuration file.
- LINE\_OPT\_VALUE\_ONELINE: each value in an array or keyword/value pair in a hash must be on a separate line. This results in
several instances of the same keyword (multiple lines) in the configuration file.
- LINE\_OPT\_VALUE\_UNIQUE: each values are concatenated as a space-separated string
- LINE\_OPT\_VALUE\_SORTED: values are sorted
- LINE\_OPT\_HASH\_SEP\_COLON: when LINE\_VALUE\_HASH, use a colon between each hash key and value.
- LINE\_OPT\_SEP\_COLON: use a colon between keyword and value.
- LINE\_OPT\_SEP\_EQUAL: use an equal sign between keyword and value.
- LINE\_VALUE\_OPT\_SPACE\_AROUND\_SEP: when updating the value, put a space around the 
keyword/value separator.

$FILE\_INTRO\_xxx: constants defining the expected header lines in the configuration file

        line\_fmt : line format (see LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants)
        value\_fmt : value format (see LINE\_VALUE\_xxx constants)
        line\_opt: line rendering options

    Return value:
        A string corresponding to the value formatted according to the format specified by arguments
        or undef in case of an internal error (missing arguments)

- \_formatConfigLine

    This function formats a configuration line using keyword and value,
    according to the line format requested. Values containing spaces are
    quoted if the line format is not LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL.

    Arguments :
        keyword : line keyword
        value : keyword value (can be an empty string)
        line\_fmt : line format (see LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants)
        line\_opt: line rendering options

    Return value:
        A string corresponding to the line formatted according to line\_fmt
        or undef in case of an internal error (missing arguments)

- \_escape\_regexp\_string

    Help method to escape all characters with a special interpretation in the context
    of a regexp.

    Arguments:
        regexp\_str: initial regexp string (characters not escaped)

    Return value:
        string: regexp with all specail characters escaped

- \_buildLinePattern

    This function builds a pattern that will match an existing configuration line for
    the configuration parameter specified. The pattern built takes into account the line format.
    Every whitespace in the pattern (configuration parameter) are replaced by \\s+.
    If the line format is LINE\_FORMAT\_KW\_VAL, no whitespace is
    imposed at the end of the pattern, as this format can be used to write a configuration
    directive as a keyword with no value.

    Arguments :

        line\_fmt: line format (see LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants)
        line\_opt: line rendering options
        config\_value: when defined, make it part of the pattern (used when multiple lines
                      with the same keyword are allowed)

    Return value:
        A string containing the pattern to use to match the line in the file or undef
        in case of an internal error (missing argument or an invalid line format).

- \_commentConfigLine

    This function comments out a configuration line matching the configuration parameter.
    Match operation takes into account the line format.

    Arguments :
        config\_param: parameter to update
        line\_fmt : line format (see LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants)
        line\_opt: line rendering options

    Return value:

    line formatting based on the line format.

    Arguments :
        config\_param: parameter to update
        config\_value: parameter value (can be an empty string)
        line\_fmt: line format (see LINE\_FORMAT\_xxx constants)
        line\_opt: line rendering options
        multiple: if true, multiple lines with the same keyword can exist (D: false)

    Return value:
        undef or 1 in case of an internal error (missing argument)

- \_parse\_rule

    Parse a rule and return as a hash the information necessary to edit lines. If the rule
    condition is not met, undef is returned. If an error occured, the hash contains more
    information about the error.

    Arguments :
        rule: rule to parse
        config\_options: configuration parameters used to build actual configuration
        parser\_options: a hashref defining options to modify the behaviour of this function

    Supported entries for options hash:
        always\_rules\_only: if true, apply only rules with ALWAYS condition (D: false). See introduction
                           about the ALWAYS condition.
        remove\_if\_undef: if true, remove matching configuration line if rule condition is not met (D: false)

    Return value: undef if the rule condition is not met or a hash with the following information:
        error\_msg: a non empty string if an error happened during parsing
        remove\_matching\_lines: a boolean indicating that the matching lines must be removed
        option\_sets: a list of option sets containing the attribute to use in the updated line
        attribute: the option attribute to use in the updated line

- \_apply\_rules

    Apply configuration rules. This method is the real workhorse of the rule-based editor.

    Arguments :
        config\_rules: config rules corresponding to the file to build
        config\_options: configuration parameters used to build actual configuration. Note that keys in the
                        config\_options hash are interpreted as escaped (generally harmless if they are not as the
                        killing sequence, '\_'+ 2 hex digit, is unlikely to occur in this context. Use camel case
                        for keys to prevent problems).
        parser\_options: a hash setting options to modify the behaviour of this function

    Supported entries for options hash:
        always\_rules\_only: if true, apply only rules with ALWAYS condition (D: false)
