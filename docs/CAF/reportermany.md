### NAME

CAF::ReporterMany - Class for console & log message reporting in CAF applications,
which allows more than one object instance each with its own reporting setup.

### DESCRIPTION

`CAF::ReporterMany` provides class methods for message reporting
just like [CAF::Reporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/CAF::Reporter) does, with the main distinction that
multiple instances do not share the reporter setup
(e.g. they can each have their own debuglevel).
